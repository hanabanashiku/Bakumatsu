  description: "A breechloading, bolt-action gun originally developed by the German
    gunsmith von Dreyse for use by Prussian infantry. The gun is called Z\xFCndnadelgewehr
    in German, named for its unique needle-like firing pin. The gun used a paper catridge
    which allowed it to be loaded much more easily than a typical matchlock gun."
