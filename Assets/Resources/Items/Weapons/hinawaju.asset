  description: A matchlock-configured long gun. Based on snap matchlocks introduced
    by the Portuguese in the 16th centiry, the Hinawaju quickly replaced the yumi
    as the dominate ranged weapon. Though antiquiated, this more traditional firearm
    has started to see a resurgence, owing to nostalgia and increased demand.
