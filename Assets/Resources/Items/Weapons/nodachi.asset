  description: The nodachi is a longsword. The blade is about three shaku long, longer
    than a katana, but not as long as a naginata. It is too long to be carried through
    the obi, so it is worn on the back rather than at the waist. Due to a shogunal
    law enacted in the 17th century mandating a maximum sword length, nodachi have
    become increasingly rare as of late, and as such, they are most often used for
    ceremonial purposes rather than for actual combat.
