  description: "Colloquially known as the Chassepot, this gun is a bolt-action, breech-loading
    rifle of French design. After its inception, it quickly replaced the Mini\xE9
    in France, though adoption has been slower in Japan due to a limited number of
    units making it ashore. The gun's paper catridges hold more gunpowder than the
    Dreyse catridges, allowing it to achieve a much larger maximum range."
