  description: A straight-edged knife. Tanto can be single or double edged, and are
    fairly long, at one shaku in length. Similar to the way the wakizashi pairs with
    the katana, this blade is often paired with the tachi. The tanto has become less
    common, as there are a limited amount of people that still forge them. Newly forged
    tanto are often made in the style of Muromachi or Kamakura-era blades.
